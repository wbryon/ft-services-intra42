# ft-services

 This is a System Administration and Networking project

Ft_services will introduce you to Kubernetes. You will discover cluster management and
deployment with Kubernetes. You will virtualize a network and do "clustering".
The project consists of setting up an infrastructure of different services.
To do this, you must use Kubernetes. You will need to set up a multi-service cluster.
Each service will have to run in a dedicated container.
Each container must bear the same name as the service concerned and for performance
reasons, containers have to be build using Alpine Linux.
